# I Love Ads for Useless Apps

When I remove my software development glasses and look at the world as an average consumer, this is how I perceive the word "app":

> An "app" is a small, handy application that I install on my mobile phone. I use these apps: Calendar, Contacts, WhatsApp, Twitter, Reddit, Maps, etc.

However, when I put on my software development glasses, my perspective shifts:

> Most apps are useless. There are useful apps, but the majority could simply be websites. Useful apps are those which provide offline capabilities. Apps that don't work offline could typically be implemented through traditional web development.

**I Love Ads for Useless Apps**

I believe that as of today, January 2024, most people think of a useful, handy application when they hear the term "app." I predict this perception will change.

Apps are ubiquitous today: my grocery store, my health insurance provider, my favorite radio station - they all want me to install their app. I don't want to!

That's precisely why I love ads for useless apps. They contribute to changing the public perception of apps.

Keep advertising useless apps, please. This will lead people to begin disliking the overload of apps.

This shift benefits us web developers aiming to make the web more attractive: a great platform for both consumers and producers.

Just wait a few years, and this undue hype about apps will fade, bringing the web back into focus.

This change will likely make overly complicated web development frameworks (like React, Vue, Svelte) less attractive and pave the way for straightforward frameworks like [htmx.org](//htmx.org).

Let's wait and see.

Have fun!
